# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hey there! I'm Michael Wiciak, your friendly neighborhood software enthusiast. ðŸŽ‰ If you're as passionate about diving into complex problems as I am, youâ€™re in the right place! Whether itâ€™s coding up innovative solutions, fine-tuning machine learning models, or hacking together something cool for a group project, I thrive on challenges.

As I prepare to graduate with a degree in **Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence** from the **University of Leeds**, my playground is full of exciting projects. From developing an app that automates badminton court bookings (because why not make life easier?) to creating a nifty scheduler that helps students juggle deadlines, I've been busy building tools that make a difference.

Oh, did I mention I co-founded **TimetableX**? This project has helped hundreds of students keep their coursework organized while I flexed my React and TypeScript skillsâ€”what a ride! ðŸš€

When Iâ€™m not immersed in code, you can find me teaching others how to solder RC cars, casually speaking Polish or basic Chinese (just for fun), or playing badminton. Iâ€™m so committed that Iâ€™ve even built tools to book the courts automaticallyâ€”yes, Iâ€™m that dedicated!

Iâ€™m proficient in Python, C, C++, and a handful of other languages. Got a new language you want to challenge me with? Bring it on! ðŸ’ª

For detailed descriptions of each project and how they work, hop on over to my website: [michaewiciak.com](http://michaelwiciak.com)! Dive in, explore, and letâ€™s chase something new togetherâ€”whether itâ€™s a coding challenge, a cool project idea, or simply learning how to work smarter.

Happy coding! âœ¨
